You can help in 2 different ways:

 - Completing and maintaining an already existing translation

 - Adding a completly new translation

Both are really easy to do and require not initial knowlegde of any kind.

## Participating in an already existing translation

We use the github standard pull-request mechanism (used by a lot of open source projects).

 1. Fork the git repository
  - Install git in your computer
  - Check that you can access it from a terminal by running "git --version" it should display something like "git version X.X.X.X"
  - Navigate to a directory where you want to store the tutorial website.
  - Run "git clone -b gh-pages https://github.com/your-forked-repository", this will create a directory "opengl-tutorial" in the directory where you run that command line.
  - In case you run in any issue, [here is the complete documentation of GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

 2. Open the directory and find the file you want to edit.
