<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We recently decided to change the license of the tutorials, and this is a good opportunity to break the silence on the RSS feed.</p>
<p>We chose the Creative Commons license CC-BY-NC-ND. For those of you who don't speak legalese, it means :</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 16px;">BY : If you quote or use the tutorial's webpages, you have to say that it comes from opengl-tutorial.org</span></li>
<li>NC : Non-commercial. Basically, you can't make an e-book out of the tutorials and sell it =)</li>
<li>ND : No Derivatives. The rationale is not to block "forks", but to have word in the decision. For instance, we are currently collaborating with the French site Developpez.com for a french translation. Basically : send us an e-mail !</li><br />
</ul>
<p><br />
These changes only affect the webpages. The source code remains under the WTF Public License. To quote it, you just do what the f*** you want to : create a commercial software from it, buy us a beer, etc :-)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>These informations are available on the download page :&nbsp;http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/download/</p>
