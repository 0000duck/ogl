<p>In real-time graphics, it is important to keep an eye on performance. A good practice is to choose a target FPS ( usually 60 or 30 ) and make everything possible to stick to it.</p>
<p>A FPS counter looks like this :</p>
<pre> double lastTime = glfwGetTime();<br />
 int nbFrames = 0;
<p> do{</p>
<p>     // Measure speed<br />
     double currentTime = glfwGetTime();<br />
     nbFrames++;<br />
     if ( currentTime - lastTime &gt;= 1.0 ){ // If last prinf() was more than 1 sec ago<br />
         // printf and reset timer<br />
         printf("%f ms/frame\n", 1000.0/double(nbFrames));<br />
         nbFrames = 0;<br />
         lastTime += 1.0;<br />
     }</p>
<p>     ... rest of the main loop<br />
There is an odd thing in this code. It displays the time, in milliseconds, needed to draw a frame (averaged on 1 second) instead of how many frame were drawn in the last second.</p>
<p>This is actually <strong>much better</strong>. Don't rely on FPS. Never. FramesPerSecond = 1/SecondsPerFrame, so this is an inverse relationship, and we humans suck at understanding this kind of relationship. Let's take an example.</p>
<p>You write a great rendering function that runs at 1000 FPS ( 1ms/frame ). But you forgot a little computation in a shader, which adds an extra cost of 0.1ms. And bam, 1/0.0011 = 900. You just lost 100FPS. Morality : <strong>never use FPS for performance analysis.</strong></p>
<p>If you intend to make a 60fps game, your target will be 16.6666ms ; If you intend to make a 30fps game, your target will be 33.3333ms. That's all you need to know.</p>
